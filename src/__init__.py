"""
Quantum-Enhanced Image Retrieval System
======================================

This package implements a hybrid classical-quantum image retrieval system
using quantum amplitude estimation for computing image similarities.

Main Components:
- Classical: CNN-based feature extraction using ResNet-50
- Quantum: AE-QIP algorithm for similarity computation
- Hybrid: Integration of classical and quantum components
